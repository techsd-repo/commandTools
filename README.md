# commandTools

This is an open-source command Tools program for Windows
Hopefully, I will be making a GUI version for this as well.

IDE: Visual Studio(I'm on a mac, so I use a Windows 10 VM)

Language: C#

Tools:
1. "sysmon"
2. "Run a process"
3. "Strip down browser, runs with the IE rundering engine"
